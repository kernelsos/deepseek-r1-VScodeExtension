# VSCode deepseek Coding Agent.
* I built a VSCode extension powered by a powerful open-source deepseek-R1 model. 

## Features
* No API KEY
* You can download and select from different powerful models for coding.
* Since models are downloaded locally, 100% privacy (you are not agreeing to send your prompt and keystrokes to the government).
* You can add multiple files to the context and ask questions about your code. 

## Requirements
* Install Ollama and download an LLM Model.
* For example, I used Deepseek-R1 for this project. You can run this command "ollama run deepseek-r1:1.5b" inside the terminal to download the model.
* You need to have Node version 18 installed.
* Clone the repository.
* Open the project in VS Code and in the search bar of VS Code type this command and click on this option ">Debug: start Debugging."
* VS Code will going to open a new VS Code window. This new window will going to have your extension installed.
* Now type this command in the new VS Code window search bar: ">chat with LLM."
* And Now You can test your extension, select and try out different models, debug, and chat locally inside vscode.

# Issues
* If you are facing any issues, then you can contact me and ask questions. 
* Thank you!
